# 🧠 Smart Money Concept (SMC)

Smart Money Concept is not about reading the market —  
it is about understanding the **behavior and intent of institutions** behind price movement.

📈 Markets don’t become clear by watching them —  
they become clear by **documenting what you think is happening and why**.

This repository is a structured record of my learning and paper-trading practice while studying **Smart Money Concepts (SMC)**.

🔍 The focus is on:
- Market structure & trend logic  
- Liquidity behavior  
- Break of Structure (BOS) & Change of Character (CHoCH)  
- Rule-based decision making  

🧪 Every idea here is treated as an experiment:  
tested → validated → refined → or discarded.

🚫 This is **not** a results showcase.  
🧩 It is a **thinking system under construction**.
