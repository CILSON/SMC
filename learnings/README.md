# Learnings

This directory contains formalized learnings and conceptual refinements derived from the study and application of Smart Money Concepts (SMC).

Each file represents a single validated concept or correction of prior assumptions, documented only after sufficient clarity has been achieved through observation, testing, or repeated exposure in live market conditions.

# Documentation Standards

- One concept per file

- Concepts are maintained and refined, not duplicated

- Updates reflect evolution in understanding, not opinion changes

- Supporting charts and price examples are included where relevant

- Language is kept precise, explicit, and non-ambiguous

# Objective

- Convert discretionary market observations into structured, repeatable understanding

- Minimize subjectivity by enforcing clear definitions and boundaries

- Create a durable reference for rule derivation and systemization

- Track conceptual maturity as market understanding compounds over time
