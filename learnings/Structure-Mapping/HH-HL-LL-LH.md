# HH / HL & LL / LH (Market Structure)

Market structure is defined by the relationship between **swing highs and swing lows**.

---

## Definitions

### Higher High (HH)
A **Higher High** is formed when price creates a new high **above the previous swing high**.

Condition:
- Previous swing high is broken
- Occurs after a Higher Low (in an uptrend context)

---

### Higher Low (HL)
A **Higher Low** is formed when price creates a new low **above the previous swing low**.

Condition:
- Price retraces but fails to make a lower low
- Indicates strength in buyers

---

### Lower Low (LL)
A **Lower Low** is formed when price creates a new low **below the previous swing low**.

Condition:
- Previous swing low is broken
- Occurs after a Lower High (in a downtrend context)

---

### Lower High (LH)
A **Lower High** is formed when price creates a new high **below the previous swing high**.

# Trend Definition

Trend is defined using **Price Structure**, not indicators.

---

## Types of Trend

### Uptrend 📈
An uptrend is present when price forms:
- **Higher Highs (HH)**
- **Higher Lows (HL)**

Minimum confirmation:
- At least **one HH and one HL**

---

### Downtrend 📉
A downtrend is present when price forms:
- **Lower Lows (LL)**
- **Lower Highs (LH)**

Minimum confirmation:
- At least **one LL and one LH**

---

## Key Notes
- A single HH or LL does NOT confirm a trend
- Trend must be assessed on **higher time frames first**
- Structure defines bias before execution

---

## Rule Extracted
Trend bias is defined only by HH/HL or LL/LH on the higher time frame.
