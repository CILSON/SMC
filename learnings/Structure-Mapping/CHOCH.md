# Change of Character (CHoCH)

---

## Definition
A **Change of Character (CHoCH)** occurs when price **breaks a key structural level against the prevailing trend**, indicating a **potential trend reversal**.

- In an **uptrend** → CHoCH = break of the previous **Higher Low (HL)**
- In a **downtrend** → CHoCH = break of the previous **Lower High (LH)**

CHoCH signals that momentum is shifting.

---

## Purpose of CHoCH
- Identifies **loss of trend strength**
- Acts as an **early warning**, not confirmation
- Used to shift bias, not to enter blindly

---

## Conditions for CHoCH

### 1️⃣ Trend Context
- Trend must be clearly defined first (HH/HL or LL/LH)
- Without a prior trend, CHoCH is meaningless

---

### 2️⃣ Structural Break
- Price must **close beyond** the key counter-trend level:
  - Below HL in an uptrend
  - Above LH in a downtrend
- Wicks alone are not sufficient

---

### 3️⃣ POI & Liquidity Interaction (Contextual)
CHoCH commonly occurs after:
- Price **reaches a Point of Interest (POI)**  
  *(order block, supply/demand, HTF level)*  
**or**
- Price **removes liquidity** before reversing

This interaction adds **probability**, not a requirement.

---

### 4️⃣ IDM (Inducement)
- If price has not reached a clear POI,
- The **first internal high/low** acts as **IDM**
- Breaking that internal level shows intent before the main break

IDM helps distinguish real shifts from noise.

---

## What CHoCH Is NOT
- Not a confirmed reversal
- Not an entry signal by itself
- Not valid without HTF context

---

## Relationship with BOS
- **BOS** → continuation with trend
- **CHoCH** → potential reversal against trend

---

## Visual Example

![Change of Character Example](../../charts/Structure-Mapping/choch.png)

The candle closes beyond the counter-trend structural level, signaling loss of trend control.

---

## Rule Extracted
Bias can change only after a valid CHoCH with candle close against the prior trend.
